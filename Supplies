This is a list of the supplies I used to make my Cluster a reality. You can choose different things but the concept is all still the same.

1: Raspberry Pi 4 Model B Rev 1.4
	This Pi acts as my Master Node in the Cluster
1: Raspberry Pi 3 Model B Rev 1.2
	This Pi acts as my first Slave Node in the Cluster
1: Netgear GS605 Ethernet Switch
	The Switch allows the Nodes to talk to each other 	  and gives the base to add more Nodes
2: 3' Ethernet Cables
	The cables are needed to connect the Pi's to the 	 switch
1: Power Strip (6 outlet)
	Makes thing easier to power things all from one spot

You may also need a monitor, Mouse & keyboard, cooling fans, SSD's for storage and anything else if you don't have them already or want added features that is your choice.
