You are going to start with you Master Node first. Get it up and running and set up how you want it.

Now we begin the Setup to get it ready for use in the Cluster before we copy the Micro SD for use in the Slave Node.

Reboot as needed through out this process.

Step 1-
	~Enter the Terminal and type:
		sudo raspi-config
	~Enable SSH under 
		"Interface Options > SSH"
	~Then change the host name under 
		"System options > Host name"
    Change it to something like "Master" you'll
    need it later.
